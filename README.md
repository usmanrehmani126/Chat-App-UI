5): Navigate to Desired Directory: Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where you want to store the cloned project. For example:
cd Documents/Projects

6): Clone the Repository: In the terminal, paste the URL you copied from the GitHub repository and use the git clone command to clone the project. For HTTPS URL:
cd repository-name

7): Install Dependencies: React Native projects usually have dependencies that need to be installed. Run the following command to install them:
npm install

8): Start the Frontend React Native Project: Depending on the project, you might have different ways to start it. Typically, for a React Native project, you would use:
npm start or npx react-native start


Explore the Project: The cloned React Native project is now running on your local machine. You can explore the code, make modifications, and see the changes live on the emulator or device.

10): By following these steps, you'll successfully clone a React Native project from GitHub and have it up and running on your local development environment."
